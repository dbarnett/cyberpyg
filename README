RoboPyg
=======

RoboPyg wants to highlight your syntax. It's designed to be a flexible syntax
highlighting / lexing framework that learns by example. Feed it pre-highlighted
syntax, and it will guess how to highlight more of the same syntax. No more
writing arcane spec files to configure syntax highlighting for your new file
format! (Well, that's the dream, anyway)

* Syntax highlighting is great, but writing lexers sucks
